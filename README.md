Hi! Here is my code for data analysis about fishes :)

All the data in data folder is from a recently published Nature paper:
Clark, T.D., Raby, G.D., Roche D.G., Binning, S.A., Speers-Roesch, B., Jutfelt, F. and Sudin, J. 2020. Ocean acidification does not impair the behaviour of coral reef fishes. Nature, 577: 370-375.

There is a boxplot with each fish picture, which comes from pics folder, in output/figures.

.gitignore file help me to hide the mentioned boxplot image on the github site.

Rmarkdown file is a code collection, where we paly around with data and data analysis.

We tried to figure out the difference among each species.

Also we posted pictures of each species on boxplot., which are in output/figures.

Then, we choose one of species, lemon, to figure out where there is significant difference in treatment and control group.
