Hi! Here is my code for data analysis about fishes :)

All the data is from a recently published Nature paper:
Clark, T.D., Raby, G.D., Roche D.G., Binning, S.A., Speers-Roesch, B., Jutfelt, F. and Sudin, J. 2020. Ocean acidification does not impair the behaviour of coral reef fishes. Nature, 577: 370-375.

And we try to figure out the difference of trearement in different species.

Also we post picture of each species on boxplot.
